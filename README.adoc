nncmpp
======

'nncmpp' is yet another MPD client.  It is in effect a simplified TUI version
of Sonata.  I had already written a lot of the required code before, so I had
the perfect opportunity to get rid of the unmaintained Python application and
make the first TUI client that doesn't feel awkward to use.

If it's not obvious enough, the name is a pun on all those ridiculous client
names, and should be pronounced as "nincompoop".

Features
--------
Currently it's still under development but it's already useful enough for me
to use it exclusively.  Note that since I only use the filesystem browsing mode,
that's also the only thing I care to implement for the time being.

Packages
--------
Regular releases are sporadic.  git master should be stable enough.  You can get
a package with the latest development version from Archlinux's AUR, or from
openSUSE Build Service for the rest of mainstream distributions.  Consult the
list of repositories and their respective links at:

https://build.opensuse.org/project/repositories/home:pjanouch:git

Building and Running
--------------------
Build dependencies: CMake, pkg-config, help2man, liberty (included),
                    termo (included) +
Runtime dependencies: ncursesw, libunistring, cURL

 $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/pjanouch/nncmpp.git
 $ mkdir nncmpp/build
 $ cd nncmpp/build
 $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
 $ make

To install the application, you can do either the usual:

 # make install

Or you can try telling CMake to make a package for you.  For Debian it is:

 $ cpack -G DEB
 # dpkg -i nncmpp-*.deb

Note that for versions of CMake before 2.8.9, you need to prefix `cpack` with
`fakeroot` or file ownership will end up wrong.

Having the program installed, create a configuration file and run it.

Configuration
-------------
Create _~/.config/nncmpp/nncmpp.conf_ with contents like the following:

....
settings = {
	address    = "localhost:6600"
	password   = "<your password>"
	root       = "~/Music"
}
colors = {
	normal     = ""
	highlight  = "bold"
	elapsed    = "reverse"
	remains    = "ul"
	tab_bar    = "reverse"
	tab_active = "ul"
	even       = ""
	odd        = ""
	selection  = "reverse"
	scrollbar  = ""
}
streams = {
	"dnbradio.com" = "http://www.dnbradio.com/hi.m3u"
	"BassDrive.com" = "http://bassdrive.com/v2/streams/BassDrive.pls"
}
....

Terminal caveats
----------------
This application aspires to be as close to a GUI as possible.  It expects you
to use the mouse (though it's not required).  Terminals are, however, somewhat
tricky to get consistent results on, so be aware of the following:

 - use a UTF-8 locale to get finer resolution progress bars and scrollbars
 - Xterm needs `XTerm*metaSendsEscape: true` for the default bindings to work
 - urxvt's 'vtwheel' plugin sabotages scrolling
