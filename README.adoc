nncmpp
======

'nncmpp' is yet another MPD client.  It does exactly what I want it to, more
specifically it's a simplified TUI version of Sonata so that I don't need to
run an ugly undeveloped Python application.

If it's not obvious enough, the name a pun on all those ridiculous client names,
and should be pronounced as "nincompoop".

Currently it's under development and doesn't work in any sense yet.

Packages
--------
Regular releases are sporadic.  git master should be stable enough.  You can get
a package with the latest development version from Archlinux's AUR, or from
openSUSE Build Service for the rest of mainstream distributions.  Consult the
list of repositories and their respective links at:

https://build.opensuse.org/project/repositories/home:pjanouch:git

Building and Running
--------------------
Build dependencies: CMake, pkg-config, liberty (included), termo (included) +
Runtime dependencies: ncursesw, libunistring

 $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/pjanouch/nncmpp.git
 $ mkdir nncmpp/build
 $ cd nncmpp/build
 $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
 $ make

To install the application, you can do either the usual:

 # make install

Or you can try telling CMake to make a package for you.  For Debian it is:

 $ cpack -G DEB
 # dpkg -i nncmpp-*.deb

Note that for versions of CMake before 2.8.9, you need to prefix `cpack` with
`fakeroot` or file ownership will end up wrong.

Having the program installed, create a configuration file and run it.

Configuration
-------------
Create _~/.config/nncmpp/nncmpp.conf_ with contents like the following:

....
settings = {
	address = "localhost"
	password = "<your password>"
	root = "~/Music"
}
colors = {
	header = "reverse"
	header_active = "underline"
	even = "16 231"
	odd = "16 255"
}
....
