Name
----
nncmpp - terminal-based MPD client

Synopsis
--------
*nncmpp* [_OPTION_]...

Description
-----------
*nncmpp* is a terminal-based GUI-like MPD client.  On start up it will welcome
you with an overview of all key bindings and the actions they're assigned to.
Individual tabs can be switched to either using the mouse or by pressing *M-1*
through *M-9*, corresponding to the order they appear in.

Options
-------
*-d*, *--debug*::
	Adds a "Debug" tab showing all MPD communication and other information
	that help debug various issues.

*-h*, *--help*::
	Display a help message and exit.

*-V*, *--version*::
	Output version information and exit.

Configuration
-------------
Unless you run MPD on a remote machine, on an unusual port, or protected by
a password, the client doesn't need a configuration file to work.  It is,
however, likely that you'll want to customize the looks or add some streams.
You can start off with the following snippet:

....
settings = {
	address    = "localhost:6600"
	password   = "<your password>"
	root       = "~/Music"
}
colors = {
	normal      = ""
	highlight   = "bold"
	elapsed     = "reverse"
	remains     = "ul"
	tab_bar     = "reverse"
	tab_active  = "ul"
	even        = ""
	odd         = ""
	selection   = "reverse"
	multiselect = "-1 6"
	scrollbar   = ""
}
streams = {
	"dnbradio.com" = "http://www.dnbradio.com/hi.m3u"
	"BassDrive.com" = "http://bassdrive.com/v2/streams/BassDrive.pls"
}
....

Terminal attributes are accepted in a format similar to that of *git-config*(1),
only named colours aren't supported.  The distribution contains example colour
schemes in the _contrib_ directory.

// TODO: it seems like liberty should contain an includable snippet about
//   the format, which could form a part of nncmpp.conf(5).

Files
-----
*nncmpp* follows the XDG Base Directory Specification.

_~/.config/nncmpp/nncmpp.conf_::
	The configuration file.
